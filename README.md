# Automated Server Deployment with Ansible, Portainer Templates and Caddy Reverse Proxy

## Description

This repository contains Ansible playbooks and roles designed to facilitate the fully automated deployment of hardened servers. These servers can be provisioned either on Vagrant test machines for development and testing purposes or on production servers for live deployments. The primary goal of this project is to simplify the server deployment process while incorporating essential server services such as Caddy, Watchtower, Autoheal, and Fail2Ban through Portainer templates.

## Introduction

In today's fast-paced development environment, having a streamlined and automated server deployment process is crucial. This repository provides a collection of Ansible playbooks and roles that can deploy fully configured and hardened servers with minimal effort. Whether you are setting up a development environment using Vagrant test machines or deploying on production servers, this project has you covered.

## Features

- **Ansible Playbooks & Roles:** The project includes a set of Ansible playbooks and roles that automate the deployment process.
- **Hardened Server:** The deployment process ensures that the server is securely hardened, making it more resilient to potential threats.
- **Vagrant Test Machines:** You can use Vagrant to create and test server configurations in a controlled environment.
- **Production Servers:** The playbooks can also be used to deploy servers in production environments.
- **Portainer Templates:** Essential server services such as Caddy, Watchtower, Autoheal, and Fail2Ban are integrated into Portainer templates for easy management.
- **Caddy Reverse Proxy:** Caddy is used as a reverse proxy for efficient and secure web traffic management.
